The OWASP Benchmark project GitHub repository has moved. There is now a new GitHub organization for OWASP Benchmark at:

https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark

and what was https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark is now: https://github.com/OWASP-Benchmark/BenchmarkJava

Over time, additional subprojects are going to be added to this new OWASP Benchmark project, such as BenchmarkUtils, BenchmarkDotNet, etc.
